## Usage

Once installed:

- The extension automatically scans each visited website.
- If the RTA meta tag is found, an overlay appears with a warning message.
- Choose to continue on the site ("Yes") or be redirected to Google ("No").

## Testing

### Test Scenario: Visiting an Adult Content Site

1. Navigate to a known adult content site e.g. [üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è xvideos.com](https://www.xvideos.com)
2. Upon loading, the extension should detect the RTA meta tag.
3. An overlay with the warning message should appear.
4. Test both options:
   - Clicking "Yes" should allow you to continue on the site.
   - Clicking "No" should redirect you to `www.google.com`.

Please note: This test is provided for demonstration purposes and should be conducted in a controlled, private, and appropriate environment.

## Limitations and Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

While the extension is effective in detecting adult content on websites that use the RTA (Restricted to Adults) meta tag, it has certain limitations:

- **Non-RTA Tagged Sites:** Some adult websites may not use the RTA meta tag. For instance, sites like `[noodlemagazine.com](https://noodlemagazine.com/new-video)` and `[xdosse.com](https://xdosse.com/)`, despite containing adult content, do not have this tag. Consequently, the extension will not identify these sites as adult content providers, leading to a potential under-filtering issue.
- **Reliance on Meta Tags:** The extension's current method relies solely on the presence of meta tags, which is not a comprehensive approach to content detection. Websites can contain adult content without necessarily using the RTA tag or similar identifiers.

### Planned Improvements

To address these limitations, the following improvements are planned for future versions of the extension:

- **Advanced Page Analysis:** Implementing a more sophisticated content analysis system, possibly using AI or machine learning algorithms, to detect adult content based on site characteristics beyond just meta tags.
- **User Feedback System:** Introducing a feature where users can report a site that contains adult content but is not detected by the extension. This feedback can be used to improve the detection algorithm.
- **Custom Blacklist/Whitelist:** Allowing users to manually add websites to a blacklist (to be blocked) or a whitelist (to be allowed), providing more control over the content filtering process.
